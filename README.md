## What It Does

PLXYGROUND is a sports-tech platform that bridges the gap between brands and content creators. Brands post sponsorship opportunities; creators browse, apply, and manage collaborations — all through a unified mobile app with role-specific flows.

I am the **sole developer** on this project, responsible for the full stack: API design, database schema, authentication system, admin tooling, and React Native frontend.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile Frontend | Expo React Native | Cross-platform iOS & Android from a single codebase |
| Backend API | Node.js + Express | Lightweight, fast REST API with full control |
| Database | SQLite | Zero-config relational store, ideal for early-stage product |
| Auth | JWT + RBAC | Stateless tokens with role-based access (Brand / Creator / Admin) |
| Admin Panel | HTML + Vanilla JS | Lightweight web dashboard on a dedicated port |
| Testing | Playwright | End-to-end test automation |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Automated test runs on every push |
| Deployment | Vercel | Backend hosting |

## Project Context

This app is being built during my **industry placement year** as part of a T Level in Digital Production, Design and Development. Basketball Nxtion brought me on as their sole developer to take PLXYGROUND from concept to working product.

The project has involved making real architectural decisions under real constraints — no senior developer to defer to, no existing codebase to extend.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Push notifications (Expo Notifications)
- [ ] In-app messaging between brands and creators
- [ ] Analytics dashboard for brands
- [ ] App Store / Google Play deployment
